If the system board that you have is not listed, then you will need
to port U-Boot to your hardware platform. To do this, follow these
steps:

1.  Create a new directory to hold your board specific code. Add any
    files you need. In your board directory, you will need at least
    the "Makefile" and a "<board>.c".
2.  Create a new configuration file "include/configs/<board>.h" for
    your board.
3.  If you're porting U-Boot to a new CPU, then also create a new
    directory to hold your CPU specific code. Add any files you need.
4.  Run "make <board>_defconfig" with your new name.
5.  Type "make", and you should get a working "u-boot.srec" file
    to be installed on your target system.
6.  Debug and solve any problems that might arise.
    [Of course, this last step is much harder than it sounds.]
